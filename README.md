# TICE Software – we build the TICE app

TICE is the secure app for meeting up, sharing locations and locating friends and family in real-time. TICE allows live location sharing on iOS, Android and the Web. Privacy by Design and modern end-to-end-encryption protect the sensitive location data from others.

# Open Source Development Goals

Open sourcing TICE follows our goals of making TICE more secure and growing it even further in terms of community, applications and features.

## 1. Security and transparency

As location information tells a lot about the person, access to it needs to be safeguarded. TICE therefor tries to find a good balance between a practical tool and a safe place for its users location, messaging and meta data. TICE follows the privacy by design path. This means, that we collect only the minimal amount of information needed, encrypting sensitive data in a way that we don't have access to it and be transparent by disclosing the source code behind TICE.

## 2. Grow further

We put a lot of effort into TICE. By open sourcing it, we want it to grow even further – instead of getting stuck. As the company behind TICE, we will focus on other projects in the future. That is why TICE needs you and your contribution.

## 3. Feature rich & living

TICE should be a living project and improve over time. The distributed apps over the app stores should always be up to date and accompany the operating system development. There are a lot of features missing from TICE and we want to build those together with the open source community.
